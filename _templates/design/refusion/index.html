                    <p>ReFusion is an online art exhibition made to support queer people during the full-scale invasion
                        of Ukraine by Russian
                        troops.
                    </p>
                    <p>It fuses traditional Ukrainian culture with queer art and symbols. It refuses Russian and Soviet
                        culture forced on
                        Ukraine in the past.</p>
